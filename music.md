# Music

Music has long been a huge part of my life; I have been playing violin since I was 6 and formally started composition lessons in 2019, though I've been improvising casually at the piano for far longer. Since then, I've been a part of countless orchestras and ensembles, written lots of music for various occasions, and had a lot of fun. At Brown, I'm a violinist in the Brown University Orchestra and Chamber Music Program, as well as a member of the Fermata Composers Collective.

On the academic side, I've taken classes in music theory and composition and worked as a teaching assistant for the introductory music theory course this past fall. I've also recently taken an interest in some musicology and music history research, and I'm potentially interested in exploring topics like computational musicology/music theory or generative music in more depth.

Here are some of my works from the past couple of years!
