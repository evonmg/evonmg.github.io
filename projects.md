# Projects

I've done research in behavioral economics, geochemistry, and data visualization, taken classes across close to 10 departments, and I've found it all super interesting! After quite a bit of exploring I've narrowed down my interests to the theme of thinking analytically about deeply complex human systems like language and art, but I'm always looking forward to learning about and developing skills in areas I have no experience in by diving right in.
