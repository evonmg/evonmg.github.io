# Food

I love food. In particular, as a first generation Chinese-American, I love Chinese food. Alas, I also have a deadly peanut allergy, which makes finding food I like to eat that is also safe for me very difficult. Here's a list of my favorite (safe!) eats in the Providence/Boston area in alphabetical order, I hope this helps at least one person :)

## Restaurants

**Den Den Cafe Asiana** (Providence): Asian fusion place that is completely nut free! Unfortunately their menu has gotten pretty expensive recently, but I used to go here a lot for a safe and tasty meal. Recommendations: Korean ramen, kimchi pancakes, hot stone bibimbap, seafood yaki udon

**Gene's Flatbread** (Boston): Hole in the wall Xi'an place just outside of Chinatown that's also 100% peanut free! They do spicy noodle soups with huge amounts of lamb/pork, lamb skewers, and roujiamo for *insane* prices (you can get a humongous bowl of noodles with overflowing slices of meat on top for under $12!). And did I mention how thick their noodles are?? Recommendations: hot & sour noodle soup, lamb noodle soup, pork roujiamo

**Jahunger** (locations in both Providence and Cambridge): authentic Uyghur cuisine! I love noodles and spicy food, and this place does both amazingly (the hand pulled noodles are to die for). Their kitchen is 100% peanut free! Recommendations: spicy green beans, Jahunger noodles, laghman, chicken stew (dapanji), original meefen, lamb skewer, spicy eggplant, honey cake

**Kenzoku Mazesoba** (Boston): they specialize in mazesoba (Japanese brothless ramen) but also offer other dishes like sushi. They also offer you a small bowl of rice to soak up your leftover sauce when you're done with the noodles. Recommendations: tan tan mazesoba, shoyu mazesoba, matcha latte

**Los Andes** (Providence): Peruvian place that's actually really hard to get to from campus without a car, but it's so so so good. The dishes are expensive but they're also *huge* and often contain high quality seafood so I think the prices are pretty fair. You also need to make a reservation beforehand because you will not have a table otherwise, and if you book late the only options you'll have are at like 4PM if that tells you anything about the popularity of this place. Recommendations: calamari, ceviche, paella, chaufa aeropuerto, tres leches

**Mala Noodles** (Providence): mala stir fry and hotpot that incorporates all of the ingredients you choose from a station. They don't charge based on weight so take as much stuff as you want! I personally love stacking my bowl with bok choy, wood ear fungus, tofu skin, wide potato noodles, and other ingredients from home that I miss while I'm at college. They do use some sort of sesame paste in their broth, which often contains peanuts, so I double check every time in case they change their supplier at some point, though I've never had any issues here so far. Recommendations: all of the aforementioned ingredients. Personally I prefer the soup, not least because it's a ton of food that I can split between multiple meals

**Miraku** (Boston): Some of the best ramen I've ever had hands down. Their menu is tiny (only 3 ramen flavors!), but from what I can tell they are all beautifully crafted and delicious and the broths are magical. Apparently they've gotten recognition from Michelin?? Recommendations: everything!

**Santouka** (Back Bay and Cambridge): they have delicious ramen, toppings, and sides and some pretty good deals for students (make sure to bring your student ID!). Their menu is pretty small, but you can't go wrong with anything on it. Recommendations: any of the ramen flavors, gyoza, takoyaki

**Tallulah's Tacqueria** (Providence): Mexican tacos, quesadillas, tortas, and bowls. They used to be pretty good for the price, but inflation has hit them as well and they no longer offer free guac :( I've only ever gotten their bowl, but I've sampled pretty much every meat option on the menu and I have to say they're all very good. Recommendations: there is no bad combination!

**Ten Second Yunnan Rice Noodle (Shimiaodao)** (Boston): chain restaurant from the mainland in Chinatown that sells a modern take on Yunnan rice noodles, or "crossing the bridge noodles" (过桥米线). Traditionally, they're made in a clear, milky pork broth that has been simmering for hours, as legend has it that a woman had to cross a bridge every day to bring the soup to her husband, but here they sell broths in all sorts of flavors. The only time I've been here, it was snowing really hard outside and the soup warmed me up like a hug and I'll never forget it. Recommendations: you can't go wrong, but the golden soup is really great if you're into hot and sour flavors!

**Tora** (Boston): a tiny place in Chinatown specializing in kaisen don (seafood rice bowls). They have a lot of options and their raw fish is super fresh. Downside is that the food is quite pricy ($25-$30 per bowl on average), but worth it for a special occasion. Recommendations: you can't really go wrong here depending on your tastes, but I got the maizuru don and found it really good in terms of value and also variety of seafood

**Wara Wara** (Providence): upscale ramen place a bit away from Brown's campus, but easily accessible via the RIPTA. They have a lunch menu where you can get any bowl and a side salad for $15, which is amazing because it's a ton of food and the dinner menu is quite a bit more expensive. I don't know if they use peanuts, but they've always been really great about accommodating me. Recommendations: tan tan men, miso ramen, 30 hour ramen

**What A Soup** (Cambridge): Thai noodle soups and rice bowls. Their broths are amazingly flavorful, and before 2025 had pretty great prices (alas inflation hits everyone eventually...). Their kitchen is also 100% peanut free! Recommendations: any of their omelettes, basil crispy pork rice bowl, wonton tom yum noodle soup

**Yume Ga Arukara** (Boston): they basically only serve 2 dishes and it's a hot udon soup and a cold udon, both topped with sukiyaki (marinated beef). The udon is amazingly chewy and the broth in the cold udon is incredible. Recommendations: spicy cold udon (you can add extra sukiyaki if you wish)

## Sweet Treats

**Charuma Tea Bar** (Providence): amazing amazing amazing boba down the hill, you can tell they use fresh tea and fresh fruits. They also sell really great Taiwanese popcorn chicken if you're looking for something more substantial! Recommendations: lychee oolong (I think about this drink often), popcorn chicken

**Flake** (Boston): lovely little place near Coolidge Corner that only sells pastéis de nata. They also sell out really frequently from bulk online orders because they're so popular, so plan ahead! The pastéis are super crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, and they give out really detailed instructions for how to reheat their pastéis if you don't finish them fresh because they just care that much about your experience :') Recommendations: get as many pastéis as you desire…. you can get 2, 4, 8, 16, 32….

**LA Burdick** (Back Bay and Cambridge): these people serve the best hot chocolate I've ever had. Their pastries are also great, and they're all clearly labeled with common allergens. Recommendations: dark hot drinking chocolate, chocolate raspberry cake, Burdick cookie, passionfruit mousse

**Kow Kow** (Providence): they serve massive scoops of ice cream in humongous bubble waffles (don't eat anything before you go here because you *will not* be able to finish it). You can customize the base ice cream flavor, toppings, and cone flavor, and the only nuts they use are walnuts and hazelnut chocolate sauce. They also have a ton of vegan options. Recommendations: everything is good, but I really like the milk + matcha flavor with mochi and strawberries. They also have seasonal specials!

**Zinneken's** (Providence): these waffles are SO good. Perfect amount of crispy and warm but chewy on the inside :') They're super accommodating and friendly about my allergies as well, and I don't think they use peanuts at all. Recommendations: matcha strawberry waffle (this is the only waffle I've ever gotten from here and it's a limited time special, but it's just so good…)
